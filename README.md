Reflection

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure functionality by writing unit tests to validate expected behavior and uncover bugs early. By testing individual components like ContactService, I can verify that each method behaves correctly under various conditions. To ensure security, I follow principles like input validation and least privilege, and I avoid hardcoding sensitive data. Automated testing frameworks also help ensure reliability over time.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I review the project requirements carefully and translate user needs into specific testable functions. For example, if a user needs to store and update contact information, I create methods like addContact() and updateContact() and test them to ensure they meet the expected behavior. Feedback loops, pseudocode, and clear documentation help ensure the implementation matches user expectations.

How do I approach designing software?

I start by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and identifying the key objects or services needed. Then I use modular design and test-driven development (TDD) principles to guide my implementation. I build a plan through pseudocode or flowcharts, develop the code in stages, and write unit tests along the way to verify correctness. I always consider scalability and readability in my approach.
